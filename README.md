Project Steps
1.	Setup and Initialization:
o	Step 1: Install necessary tools (Python, Django, Docker, Kubernetes CLI).
o	Step 2: Set up a Docker Hub account and a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube).
o	Step 3: Initialize a new project repository and create a Git repository for version control.
2.	Developing Frontend and Backend:
o	Step 1: Create React components for the frontend.
o	Step 2: Develop backend services using Django and Node.js.
o	Step 3: Implement user authentication and authorization.
3.	Containerization and Deployment:
o	Step 1: Write Dockerfiles for each microservice and build Docker images.
o	Step 2: Create YAML files for Kubernetes deployments, services, and ReplicaSets.
o	Step 3: Deploy the application using Kubernetes and monitor the deployment.
4.	Integrating Serverless Functions:
o	Step 1: Develop serverless functions using IBM Cloud Code Engine.
o	Step 2: Deploy the serverless functions and integrate them with the microservices.
o	Step 3: Configure triggers and events for the serverless functions.
5.	Testing and Continuous Integration:
o	Step 1: Write unit tests for the frontend and backend components.
o	Step 2: Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.
o	Step 3: Continuously integrate and deploy changes to the cloud platform.
